	- Added basic map initialization with a dummy map. 
	- Very crude and basic map drawing with no textures. (Solid colors)
	- Added area at bottom for UI. Gamescreen is now split into the game's "board" and "info" sections.
	- Some kind of base class for info UI manipulation
	- Proposal UI storyboards
