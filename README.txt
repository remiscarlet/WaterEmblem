First off, PLACEHOLDER NAME (probably). \
Second, this is a FANGAME, or derivative work, of Kantai Collection, or KanColle, by DMM and Kadokawa Games.

#############
## What is ##
#############

The concept of this project is to create a game reminescent of tactical RPGs much like Fire Emblem or Advance Wars. Mechanic-wise, the gameplay will likely be much closer to the former than latter.

This game will take many mechanics and features of KanColle and attempt to integrate them into this game whilst replacing the sortie mechanics with that of a tactical rpg. Effectively, try to imagine a KanColle with an actual battle mechanic, lol

#############
## Authors ##
#############

Current authors are:
Ippikiryu, or Flan
Remi_Scarlet, or Remi

## Credits ##
#############

Even though we don't have jack shit yet, obvious credits go to DMM and Kadokawa Games for making KanColle to begin with.
