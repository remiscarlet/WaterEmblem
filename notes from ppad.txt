terrain type
	Ocean
	Shallow water
	Reefs (coral)
	Whirlpools (Visible only from certain distances)(enhanced by LoS)
	Beach -> Sea -> land or vice versa
	Dams? -> Destroy to traverse after x turns 
	Flatland
	Cliffs near water -> Can't move onto this tile from sea, blocks vision from sea 
	(Maybe bonus when firing onto sea from cliff)
	Mountain -> Untraversible. Blocks vision to ships.
	Forest -> can only fire adjacently to plains if at edge, but otherwise cannot fire from at all

Mechanics:
	LoS (Fog of War)
	Relationship status? <- stat boosts and whatnot for better relation
	Repairs/Construction instant, resource costs
	stacked units -> show the plane on top (slightly opaque) with obscured kanmusu underneath
	lighter units (DD, CL, etc)
	perhaps consider own units are not passable (enemy units obviously not possible) 

Mission Types:
	Attack an enemy fleet [Deathmatch]
	Defend base
	Support land-based forces
	Attack enemy base
	Escape

M-level: (Subject to change)
	I'm not -> Your kanmusus cannot die
	do-emu -> Kancolle type death
	Tenshi -> Kanmusus can die mid-combat (even if they were undamaged at the start)
